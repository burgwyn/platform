### Description of problem and its consequences 

We are interested to have analytics about the API key usage per API. API key is available in the API Umbrella drilldown dashboard, but does not appear to be available in the drilldown analytics results.

## Research

### Description of problem and its consequences
We need a way link to the analytics data to particular API ID. This allows us to delete the API along with corresponding analytics data. This would also improve our API owner dashboard.

### Solution options
Now it can not be resolved on the platform side via particular API ID. It depends on a structure of ElasticSearch index which doesn't support storage of API ID. [Issue] (https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/issues/25)
A suggestion is using the frontend prefix.

#### Pros
1.  After adding namespace for prefix the request path must be unique for using as link

#### Cons
1. Need to re-write realisation when ElasticSearch index will include the field for storing API ID.
